# Copilot Guidelines

This directory contains GitHub Copilot guidelines:

- [`COPILOT-UPSTREAM.md`](./COPILOT-UPSTREAM.md) - BC Government standard guidelines (automatically updated)
- `COPILOT.md` - Team-specific guidelines (optional, create this file for your team's specific patterns)

## Team Guidelines

To add team-specific guidelines:

1. Create `COPILOT.md` in this directory
2. Add your team's specific:
   - Patterns and examples
   - Project-specific contexts
   - Workflow preferences
   - Custom prompts that work well

The upstream guidelines will be automatically kept up to date through GitHub Actions.
