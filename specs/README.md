2. **Requirements** - Detailed requirements and constraints
3. **Implementation Plan** - Technical approach and phases
4. **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes and validation
5. **Notes** - Additional context and considerations

## Spec-Driven Development Workflow

1. Create specification using `/spec` command
2. Generate technical plan using `/plan` command  
3. Break down into tasks using `/tasks` command
4. Implement using AI coding assistance
5. Validate against success criteria

## Templates

See `templates/` directory for:
- Feature specification template
- Architecture specification template
